# Moxproxy

Moxproxy is java library written on the top of [LittleProxy](https://github.com/adamfisk/LittleProxy) library.
Main goal of Moxproxy library development is to support automated testing.

In current version it supports:
* http traffic recording
* request/response modification
    * headers
    * status codes
    * body
    
Documentation is still work in progress. 
Examples can be found in [mox.proxy.local.examples](https://github.com/lukasz-aw/moxproxy/tree/master/moxproxy.local.examples/src/test/java/testing/e2e) module and [moxproxy.web.service](https://github.com/lukasz-aw/moxproxy/blob/master/moxproxy.web.service/src/test/java/testing/WebServiceE2ETest.java) end to end test.

Documentation will be updated as soon as possible...
